I recently completed a Hospital Management Dashboard project🏥📊
 where I turned complex patient and hospital operations data into a clear, easy-to-understand Power BI report.
What began as a simple exploration became a deep dive into understanding how data can improve patient care, staff efficiency, and overall hospital performance.
In this dashboard, I analyzed:
 ✔️ Patient admissions & discharge trends
 ✔️ Monthly Wise Analysis
 ✔️ Department-level patient volume
 ✔️ Gender Wise Analysis
Working on this helped me understand how analytics can enhance hospital decision-making — from optimizing staff allocation to improving patient flow and identifying operational bottlenecks.
This project strengthened my skills in:
 🔹 Power BI (DAX, drilldowns, modeling)
 🔹 KPI design & data storytelling
 🔹 Healthcare domain analytics
 🔹 Visual design for management dashboards
Excited to keep growing on my analytics journey! 🚀
 Feedback is always welcome 😉
